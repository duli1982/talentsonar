## 🎓 Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### For Recruiters/Stakeholders:

**Minute 1: The Problem**
"Traditional ATS makes recruiters manually search through hundreds of CVs for each job. It takes hours and you often miss great candidates."

**Minute 2: Auto-Matching**
[Add a job]
"Watch this - I just added a Senior React Developer role. The system INSTANTLY analyzed all 55 candidates in our database and found 8 strong matches. Look at these scores: 87%, 85%, 82%..."

**Minute 3: Best Matches View**
[Click Best Matches tab]
"No more switching between tabs. This shows me the top 15 candidates across internal employees, past applicants, AND new CVs - all in one view, sorted by match quality."

**Minute 4: AI Deep Dive**
[Click "Analyze Top 10"]
"Now for the magic. One click and AI analyzes the top 10 candidates in depth. Watch the progress bar... This usually takes 15-20 minutes manually. We're doing it in 30 seconds."

**Minute 5: The Results**
[Open analysis modal]
"Look at this breakdown: not just 'React experience' but multi-dimensional fit - technical skills, career stage, learning agility, team fit. Plus skill gaps and future potential. This candidate is 87% match but has room to grow into a Staff Engineer role."

**Conclusion:**
"From 4-6 hours of manual work to 5 minutes. From keyword matching to AI-powered insights. From missing hidden gems to finding them automatically. That's the power of Talent Sonar AI."
